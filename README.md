## Project Overview

**MLOps in Travel** is an end-to-end machine learning operations (MLOps) framework tailored for travel industry analytics. The project is structured into three major modules:

- **Flight Price Prediction:** Predicts flight prices using advanced regression models trained on real-world flight data. The module supports experiment tracking, automated retraining, and API-based predictions.
- **Hotel Price Prediction:** Estimates hotel prices based on historical and contextual features. Includes a dedicated API, deployment scripts, and orchestration pipelines.
- **Gender Classification:** Classifies user gender from structured data, showcasing classification workflows and model serving.

Key highlights include:
- Modular codebase for easy extensibility and maintenance
- Automated data pipelines and workflow orchestration with Apache Airflow
- Experiment tracking and model registry with MLflow
- Containerized deployment using Docker and Kubernetes
- CI/CD automation with Jenkins
- Example notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model development

This project is ideal for data scientists, MLOps engineers, and organizations seeking to implement scalable, production-ready ML systems in the travel sector.

This structure ensures clear separation of concerns, scalability, and ease of onboarding for new contributors. Each module is self-contained, with dedicated configuration, dependencies, and deployment scripts, supporting best practices in modern MLOps.

## Features
- Modular ML projects for different travel industry tasks
- Automated data pipelines and orchestration with Airflow
- Experiment tracking with MLflow
- Containerized with Docker for reproducibility

- Example notebooks for EDA and model training

## Setup & Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sharath199324/Voyage-Analytics-Intergrating-MLOPS-in-Travel-main.git
  
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   - Each module (`flight_price`, `gender_classification`, `hotel_price`) has its own `requirements.txt`.
   - Use virtual environments for isolation.
   ```bash
   cd flight_price
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Environment Variables:**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in each module and fill in required values.

4. **Docker (Recommended):**
   - Build and run containers for each module:
   ```bash
   docker build -t flight-price-app ./flight_price
   docker run -p 8000:8000 flight-price-app
   ```

## Usage
- **Flight Price Prediction:**
  - Run `app.py` in `flight_price` for API/web interface.
  - Access the web UI at the exposed port (default: 8000).
- **Hotel Price Prediction:**
  - Similarly, run `hotel_price/app.py`.
- **Gender Classification:**
  - Run `gender_classification/app.py`.

## Model Training & Tracking
- Notebooks (`*.ipynb`) provided for EDA and model training.
- MLflow integration for experiment tracking (`flight_price/MLflow/flight_price_mlflow.py`).
- Trained models are saved as `.pkl` or `.joblib` files in respective module folders.

## Orchestration (Airflow)
- Airflow setup is provided in `flight_price/airflow_home/`.
- Start Airflow with Docker Compose:
  ```bash
  cd flight_price/airflow_home
  docker-compose up
  ```
- DAGs are located in `dags/` and can be customized for your pipeline.

## Deployment
- Dockerfiles provided for all modules.
- Kubernetes deployment YAML for hotel price app (`hotel_price/hotel-price-app-deployment.yaml`).
- CI/CD example with Jenkins (`flight_price/Jenkinsfile`).
